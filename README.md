**This dashboard was created to visualize relevant KPIs and metrics for a call center company.**

The center manager wants a dashboard prepared, to use as a basis of discussion with the management team. 

## Possible KPIs
* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

To create the database, the following **process** was followed: 
### 1. Getting the data
The required data was provided by the center manager.  
The data was in tabular form in an excel workbook.

### 2. Analysing the data
The xlsx file was uploaded into excel for data analysis and cleaning.

The image above shows a preview of the data in excel. 

Data formats were checked and the correct data formats were assigned to Date, Time and AvgTalkDuration columns.  

A pivot table was then created to show the performance of all the agents, the satisfaction rate and the distribution of calls per topic.

### 3. Creating metrics in Power BI
The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to create the dashboard.  
Different metrics were created including;  
* Average speed of answer
* Max satistaction rating
* Target satisfaction rating
